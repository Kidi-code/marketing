        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          In South Africa, agriculture is more than an economic sectorâ€”it's a
          lifeline. It provides jobs, food security, and raw materials for
          countless industries. Yet, despite its importance, thousands of new
          and small-scale farmers face systemic challenges that hinder their
          ability to access the market, scale their operations, and become
          competitive players in the supply chain. These challenges include lack
          of infrastructure, delayed payments, dependency on intermediaries,
          limited access to modern tools, and scarce market insights.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          BENTICKÂ³ CONNECT was founded with a bold vision: to create an
          inclusive and digitally enabled agricultural ecosystem that connects
          emerging farmers, local retailers, and farming equipment manufacturers
          through a single, transparent platform. Using blockchain technology in
          agriculture, we ensure secure, real-time transactions and traceable
          product journeys from farm to shelf. This empowers farmers to gain
          direct market access, ensures retailers source locally and ethically,
          and gives manufacturers a platform to support farmer growth with the
          latest tools and machinery.

          Our platform isnâ€™t just a marketplace â€” itâ€™s a movement for

          ðŸ”— How It Works â€“ Step-by-Step on the BENTICKÂ³ CONNECT Agriculture
          Platform
        </h2>

        <div className="space-y-6 text-lg">
          <p>
            <strong>1. Farmer Registration & Profile Setup:</strong> Emerging
            farmers begin by registering on the platform and creating a verified
            digital profile. This includes uploading farm certifications,
            outlining the types of produce they grow (vegetables, fruit,
            livestock, dairy, or processed goods), and specifying location,
            capacity, and harvesting cycles.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2. Product Listing and Marketplace Access:</strong> Once
            registered, farmers can list their products with images, pricing,
            harvest timelines, and certifications. Retailers, processors, and
            bulk buyers can then browse and place direct orders.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3. Secure Transactions via Smart Contracts:</strong> Each
            transaction is governed by a blockchain-based smart contract, which
            triggers automatic payments to farmers once produce is delivered and
            verified. This eliminates long payment delays and ensures that
            farmers are always compensated fairly and on time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4. Traceability from Farm to Shelf:</strong> Every stepâ€”from
            harvest to deliveryâ€”is recorded on the blockchain. This provides
            full traceability, allowing both retailers and end consumers to
            track the productâ€™s journey and guarantees compliance with food
            safety and ethical sourcing standards.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>5. Access to Equipment and Agricultural Inputs:</strong>{" "}
            Farmers can also connect with verified farming equipment
            manufacturers and suppliers directly through the platform. This
            allows them to purchase or rent tools, irrigation systems,
            machinery, fertilizers, and other essentials to boost productivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6. Real-Time Market Analytics and Insights:</strong> Using
            AI and real-time data collection, farmers get access to market
            analytics showing what products are in demand, pricing trends across
            different regions, and retailer preferences.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>7. Delivery Coordination and Support Services:</strong>{" "}
            BENTICKÂ³ CONNECT also provides logistics support by coordinating
            with third-party delivery providers or cooperatives. We help ensure
            products reach the buyer efficiently and on time, with proof of
            delivery tied to the smart contract for automated payment release.
